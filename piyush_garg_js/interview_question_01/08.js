    // Arrow functions do not have their own 'this', they inherit it from the enclosing context
    //if executed in browser, this will refer to the global/window object

};

console.log(obj.prop.getFullName);

console.log(obj.getFullName);



console.log(obj.getFullNameV2);


console.log(obj.getFullNameV3);
// In getFullNameV3, an IIFE is used which runs immediately and returns the global fullName ("Adarsh Singh") because this inside an IIFE refers to the global object. So obj.getFullNameV3 stores the string, not a function. Calling obj.getFullNameV3() throws a TypeError because you're trying to call a string as a function.
