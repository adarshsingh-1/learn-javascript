// This code demonstrates IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) and variable scoping in JavaScript. The var variable = 10 creates a global variable in the global scope. The IIFE (() => {})() executes immediately and has access to the global variable through lexical scoping. Inside the IIFE, variable = 20 modifies the same global variable (not creating a new local variable), so the change persists outside the IIFE. All four console.log statements access the same global variable, outputting: 10, 20, 20, 30. This demonstrates closure, lexical scoping, and how arrow functions inherit scope from their enclosing context without creating their own execution context.Ë€
