Object.create(p1) creates p2 with p1 as its prototype – so p2 inherits all properties and methods of p1.

Calling p2.getFullName() uses p1's method, and this refers to p2, so it looks for p2.fname and p2.lname.

If p2 doesn’t have its own properties, it uses inherited values from p1.

Modifying p2.__proto__.fname = "Rohit" actually changes p1.fname, because p2.__proto__ === p1.

So both p1.fname and p2.getFullName() reflect the updated name "Rohit Singh" after the change.



What are Wrapper Classse
Primitive types like string, number, boolean are not objects, but JavaScript allows you to use them like objects.
class String{

}


const fname = new String()

fname__proto__ = String.prototype
